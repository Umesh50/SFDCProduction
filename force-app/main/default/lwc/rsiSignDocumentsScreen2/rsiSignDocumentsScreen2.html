                    full and faithful performance and payment by Company of each of its duties and obligations to us
                    (including, without limitation, Chargebacks and obligations in connection with Leased Equipment, if
                    applicable)

                    pursuant to the Company Application and Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, with or
                    without notice. Guarantor(s) understand further that we may proceed directly against Guarantor(s)
                    without first

                    exhausting our remedies against any other person or entity responsible therefore to them or any
                    security held by us or Company. This guarantee will not be discharged or affected by the death of
                    the Guarantors, will

                    bind all heirs, administrators, representatives and assigns and may be enforced by or for the
                    benefit of any of our successors. Guarantor(s) understand that the inducement to us to accept this
                    Company Application is

                    consideration for the guaranty and that this guaranty remains in full force and effect even if the
                    Guarantor(s) receive no additional benefit from the guaranty. The undersigned hereby directs any

                    agency to furnish a consumer credit report that relates personally to the undersigned upon the
                    request of Elavon or any of its designees, successors or assigns and agrees that all parties
                    involved are in compliance

                    responsible for making all monthly payments due under the lease and that any failure to pay all
                    amounts when due

                    may result in additional charges, potential damage to my credit rating and/or legal action against

                        mean Paytree, its successors or assigns. References to “you,” “your” and “Merchant” shall mean
                        the Business indicated on the Merchant Application Agreement. The rental equipment and related
                        software indicated in the Merchant Application is hereinafter referred to as the “Equipment.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>2. <b>Debit/Credit Authorization.</b>Merchant hereby authorizes Paytree, or its designee,
                        successor or assign to automatically withdraw the base monthly payment and any other amounts,
                        including any and all loss or destruction waivers, taxes, insurance, noncompliance fees or other
                        charges now due or hereafter imposed, by initiating debit entries to any bank or other accounts.
                        The authority is to remain in full force and effect until Paytree has received the rental
                        equipment from the Merchant in such a manner as to afford Paytree reasonable opportunity to act
                        on it and all obligations of the Merchant to Paytree that have arisen under this Agreement have
                        been paid in full. In the event of default of any obligation hereunder, Merchant authorizes
                        Paytree to debit any such accounts for the full amount due. Any payment (whether paid by debit
                        or other means) that is not honored for any reason will be subject to a service fee imposed by
                        Paytree. Furthermore, Merchant hereby authorize any bank or financial institution to accept any
                        debit imposed by Paytree. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>3.<b> Warranty.</b> Equipment provided under this Agreement may be new or refurbished. Paytree
                        warrants against defects in material and workmanship but not against obsolescence of any new or
                        refurbished Equipment for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the Merchant Application is
                        signed. In the event of a defect in material or workmanship of the Equipment, Lessor’s sole
                        obligation and your exclusive remedy shall be the repair or replacement of the defective
                        Equipment at Paytree’s sole discretion. Merchant will be charged for shipping and handling for
                        all replacement Equipment. You acknowledge that we do not manufacture the Equipment. We do not
                        represent the manufacturer or the licensor of any software and you selected the equipment based
                        upon your own judgement. This warranty is exclusive and in lieu of all other warranties,
                        expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise. You agree that regardless of cause, Payree is not
                        responsible for and you will not make any claim against Paytree for any damages, including but
                        not limited to, loss of income, loss of revenue, economical loss, consequential, direct or
                        indirect, special or punitive relating to the Equipment, software or this Agreement. Paytree
                        shall not be liable for any damages caused by interruption, failure, defect, or delay in the
                        operation, maintenance, repair or replacement of the equipment. Merchant further acknowledges
                        and agrees that Paytree may require you to upgrade your equipment to an EMV capable terminal in
                        line with implementation of Brand regulations and requirements. Failure of MERCHANT to upgrade
                        may result in penalties including, but not limited to, the downgrading of transactions and
                        increased processing fees.</p>

                        Agreement has been paid in full. Your obligation to pay all base monthly and other payments
                        shall be absolute and unconditional and is not subject to any abatement, set-off, or
                        counterclaim for any reason.</p>

                        and shall not make any modifications, alterations or additions to or change the location of the
                        Equipment without the prior written consent of Paytree.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>8.<b> Wireless Terminal Coverage.</b> Merchant understands and agrees that Paytree does not

                    <br>
                    <p>9.<b> Cancellation.</b> If merchant wishes to terminate this agreement, all Equipment in fully
                        working condition must be returned within ten (10) days of their cancellation notice. If

                        account for more than thirty (30) days, Merchant will be charged for the balance of all
                        equipment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>10.<b> Insurance.</b> You shall keep the Equipment insured against all risks of loss or damage
                        from any cause whatsoever for not less than the full replacement value thereof. You shall carry

                        All such insurance shall be in form and with companies satisfactory to Paytree and shall name
                        Paytree as Loss Payee as our interest may appear with respect to property damage coverage and as
                        additional insured with respect to public liability coverage. You shall pay the premiums for
                        such insurance and deliver to Paytree satisfactory evidence of insurance coverage required
                        hereunder. You hereby irrevocably appoint Paytree as your attorney-in-fact to make claim for,

                        for loss or damage under any such insurance policy.</p>
